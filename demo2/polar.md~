This sketch draws lets you draw pretty patterns in polar coordinates. Open up polar_start.pde.

We are going to create our pattern by moving a circle around on the screen. To start with lets just draw a circle.

In the draw loop put 

```java
translate(width/2.0,height/2.0); //moves the reference point to the center of the drawing
ellipse(0,0,30,30);
```
